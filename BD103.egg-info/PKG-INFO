        ## Patch Notes
        ### 0.1.3
        _Hopefully_ fixed the `color.py` module.
        
        ### 0.1.2
        Fixed link in `README.md`.
        
        ### 0.1.1
        **Panik.** I keep on making these silly mistakes in the `color.py` module, but _thankfully_ it should be fixed now. The `print(text, color)` function is renamed to `cprint(text, color)`.
        
        ### **0.1.0**
        Fixed the `paint(color)` function in `color.py` module, as it refered to the color print function, not base print.
        
        We are now in the Beta stage. Yay! :7
        
        ### 0.0.10
        Small adjustment, made the delay between printing characters in the `scroll.py` module customizable. Also made a `clear.py` module, that clears the console screen.
        
        ### 0.0.9
        Created the `scroll.py` module, as well as adjusted `__init__.py` to import functions from modules, not just the modules themselves.
        
        ### 0.0.8
        As `0.0.7` failed to fix `engine/textdump.py`, we finally found and fixed the issue. :P
        
        ### 0.0.7
        Fixed extra `"` in `engine/textdump.py`. Updated `0.0.6` description.
        
        ### 0.0.6
        Edited 0.0.3 description of `README.md` to fix recurrent module creation. Created a comment at the top of each module that says it's part of the package. Removed color variables, as they are only handy for local modules. Fixed `engine/textdump.py` trying to save to a non-existant folder.
        
        ### 0.0.5
        Edited `README.md` to fix spacing issues. Made the `engine` sub-module. Created `engine/textdump.py`.
        
        ### 0.0.4
        Fixed `LICENSE`.
        
        ### 0.0.3
        Updated short description. Added `__all__` variable in `__init__.py`. Updated `README.md` to have full module names. Renamed `color()` function to `print()`. Updated 0.0.1 description. Added `load.py` module. Created the `parser.py` module.
        ```python
        ''' Parser '''
        bd103.parser.grid(path) # Loads a text file and creates a list. Each item is a sepperate line of the file. Returns the list (array)
        bd103.parser.space(text, identifier=" ") # Parses given string and returns an array. Each item is sepperated by spaces. "hi there" would return ["hi", "there"]
        ''' Load Bar '''
        bd103.load.load(length=100) # Automatically makes a useless loading bar
        bd103.load.loadbar(value, length=100) # Allows you to manually create a load bar that syncs with data.
        ```
        
        ### 0.0.2
        Emptied `__init__.py` to fix error. Updated `setup.py` and redid `README.md`.
        
        ### 0.0.1
        Initial package. Contains a basic color formatting module.
        ```python
        ''' Functions '''
        bd103.color.print(text, color) # Prints with text then resets formatting
        bd103.color.paint(color) # Sets color permanently until reset
        
        ''' Colors '''
        reset = "reset
        red = "red"
        yellow = "yellow"
        green = "green"
        cyan = "cyan"
        blue = "blue"
        magenta = "magenta"
        black = "black"
        white = "white"
        ```
