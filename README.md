```

Go to [Github](https://github.com/BD103/Package/wiki) for the docs. :)

## **Notice**

This package is being updated and changed away from functions and towards more developer utilities. Thank you for using the original package, but it is not being supported anymore. Any bugs found <=0.1.6 will not be fixed. You can still get this version by using `pip install bd103==0.1.6`. I hope you enjoy using the new features and changes!
