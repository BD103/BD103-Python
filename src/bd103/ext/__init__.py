"""A subpackage containing code that builds off of other external libraries.

If you just have :mod:`bd103` installed, you will not be able to use most of these modules.

Hint:
    If you want to be able to use every extension module, install :mod:`bd103` with the following command:

    .. code-block:: shell

        python -m pip install -U bd103[ext]"""
